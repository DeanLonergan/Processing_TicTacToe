This is a version of Tic-Tac-Toe written in Processing 3.5.4. I created this project during my first semester of college for Programming Fundamentals 1. 
It was a fun project to work on and introduced me to a number of fundamental programming concepts. While this version runs in Processing 3.5.4, it has 
not been tested in any other environments.
